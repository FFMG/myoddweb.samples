## C Sharp

All the C Sharp projects are located [in the same solution](https://github.com/FFMG/myoddweb.samples/tree/master/csharp)

- [Lock Speed](https://github.com/FFMG/myoddweb.samples/tree/master/csharp/lockspeed) is a very simple app to time the speed of various locks. The [accompanying article](http://www.myoddweb.com/2019/08/26/what-is-the-fastest-lock-in-c/) tries to explain what might be going on.
- [ParallelExceptions](https://github.com/FFMG/myoddweb.samples/tree/master/csharp/ParallelExceptions)  tries to explain [What happens when you throw an exception in Parallel Loops](http://www.myoddweb.com/2019/09/11/what-happens-when-you-throw-an-exception-in-parallel-loops/) if you are using `Parallel.ForEach` one of the common mistake is to use it to run async code.
